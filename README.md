I’m Houssem Eddine Fadhli, a software engineer who loves building mobile apps, mainly using Flutter but also with solid experience in Kotlin and Swift for native Android and iOS. I focus on creating scalable, high-performance apps that just work smoothly for users. Clean architecture and good design matter a lot to me, and I enjoy working in agile teams where I can take full ownership of projects, from the technical details to delivering a great product. I’m all about writing clean, maintainable code and following solid principles. I’m passionate about contributing to open source, helping other developers grow, and always improving my skills, both technical and as a leader. If you want to chat about building awesome mobile experiences or share ideas on project management and architecture, I’m all ears.
