# Software Engineer | Flutter Developer

I’m Houssem Eddine Fadhli, a software engineer who loves Flutter and mobile app development. I also have good experience with Swift, Java, and backend system design. I focus on building scalable, smooth apps using clean code and solid principles. I enjoy working in agile teams and taking full ownership of projects, from coding to delivery. I’m passionate about good architecture, project management, and helping other developers grow. I’m always learning to improve my skills, both as a coder and a leader. If you want to talk about mobile apps, architecture, or project management, feel free to reach out.
